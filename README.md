Shapes are inserted into HTML document at random size colour and shapes then timed to change every second. For loop was inserted to execute the code repeatedly to over 100 shapes within a div element.

Practical task showing how React can be used to manipulate multiple components to build interactive libraries and render multiple elements. The reusable components act as lego pieces and are pieced together to render numerous lightweight virtual layouts without having to manipulate the parent document.
